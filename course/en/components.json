As creators and supporters of electronic healthcare record software, it is necessary to understand the unique challenges and opportunities presented by working in the correctional healthcare space. Virtually everyone in a country like America has some experience with the healthcare system.<br><br>&emsp;The corrections system also provides their patients with many of the same healthcare services, with several key differences; the way a corrections patient accesses healthcare or meets with a specialty clinician is almost unrecognizable compared to the way someone with health insurance and a primary care provider might. What if a patient in corrections gets sick or injured? What if a patient with a physical injury needs adaptive equipment? How does a patient schedule a routine visit such as a yearly physical? Almost everyone outside of corrections has been through one of the situations above, but very few had a reason or need to know how someone in corrections would do the same. <br><br>&emsp;This course will introduce and illustrate some of the scenarios that take place when a patient is introduced into the correctional healthcare flow and makes use of some of the services available to patients therein.","transcriptLinkButton":"Transcript","transcriptLink":""},"_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true,"_isCompletionIndicatorEnabled":true}},{"_id":"c-15","_parentId":"b-10","_type":"component","_component":"media","_classes":"","_layout":"full","_isOptional":false,"_comment":"_setCompletionOn = inview | play | ended","_setCompletionOn":"play","_useClosedCaptions":false,"_allowFullScreen":true,"title":"Learning Objectives","displayTitle":"Learning Objectives","body":"These are the goals for learners who complete this course.","instruction":"Click the play button to start the video.","_media":{"mp4":"course/en/video/Slide002Final.mp4","poster":"course/en/video/slide002.png"},"_playerOptions":{"alwaysShowControls":true,"toggleCaptionsButtonWhenOnlyOne":true,"iPadUseNativeControls":true,"iPhoneUseNativeControls":true,"AndroidUseNativeControls":true},"_transcript":{"_inlineTranscript":true,"_externalTranscript":false,"inlineTranscriptButton":"Transcript","inlineTranscriptCloseButton":"Close Transcript","inlineTranscriptBody":"<b>Learning Objectives</b><br><br>   &emsp;<b>Action:</b> Define the correctional healthcare intake process<br>   &emsp;<b>Condition:</b> Given an overview and playable scenarios<br>&emsp;<b>Standard:</b> Demonstrate knowledge of the elements and journey flow of the correctional healthcare intake process<br>&emsp;<b>Evaluation:</b> Practical exercise & quiz","transcriptLinkButton":"Transcript","transcriptLink":""},"_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true,"_isCompletionIndicatorEnabled":true}},{"_id":"c-20","_parentId":"b-15","_type":"component","_component":"text","_classes":"","_layout":"left","title":"Introduction","displayTitle":"Course Agenda","body":"<b>Overview</b><br>⠀⠀⠀<b>Journey Flow</b><br>⠀⠀⠀<b>Roles of healthcare providers in corrections</b><br>⠀⠀⠀<b>Specialty referrals</b><br>⠀⠀⠀<b>Sick call process</b><br><b>Quiz</b>","instruction":"","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true,"_isCompletionIndicatorEnabled":false}},{"_id":"c-25","_parentId":"b-16","_type":"component","_component":"accordion","_classes":"","_layout":"full","title":"Lexicon","displayTitle":"List of Important Terminology","body":"These are some commonly-used terms in correctional healthcare.","instruction":"Click each heading to expand it and learn more.","_items":[{"title":"Custody","body":"This is the receiving office of the correctional facility.
